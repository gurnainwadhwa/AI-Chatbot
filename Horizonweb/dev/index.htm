We’ll be using an API to ping the [GPT-J model](https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/07/eleutherai-gpt-j/), the current best performing open-source Transformer model. We’ll encode a personality for this bot. Then we’ll deploy it so that hundreds of users can speak to it on [Chai](http://chai.ml), a chat-bot platform.\n\nAt Chai we have built and deployed many chatbots which currently send almost 200,000 messages / day to users, I will share a lot of the tricks we have discovered to make a good bot. All the code is in python 3.\n\nTable of contents:\n------------------\n\n· [An API for GPT-J](#684c)  \n· [Giving the bot a personality: the ChatAI class](#5ed4)  \n· [Bringing it all together](#e3c1)  \n· [All the code on GitHub for you to use](#4e98)  \n· [Uploading the bot to Chai for users to speak to it](#4c11)  \n· [Example conversation](#6503)\n\nLet’s build up to a full fledged chat-bot: first we’ll get set-up with an API to ping GPT-J, then we’ll build a ChatAI class where we define the personality of the bot, then we’ll package that into a very short python class (less than 20 lines of code!). Finally, we’ll upload the bot to [Chai](http://chai.ml).\n\nAn API for GPT-J\n================\n\nThere’s two ways we could use GPT-J: either we can install it on your machine and run it locally, or we could have it run on a server and access it through an API. Running locally is fine but is a bit trickier and doesn’t scale as well (we want to have hundreds of people speak to the bots!). So we’ll be using the [GetNeuro API](https://www.getneuro.ai/). GetNeuro charges for this but if you want to build a good bot I will give you my access credentials (email me at: dev@chai.ml).\n\nLine 27 is where we query the API provided by GetNeuro. What’s most interesting when building chat-bots is **making them sound like humans**. The first place we can do this is in the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ where we define the **temperature** and **repetition penalty** parameters. Low temperature means the model will be conservative and only return responses it is very confident make sense, high temperature means the model will send responses it is less certain of. When you set too low temperature the chat bots are very consistent but a bit boring, when you set too high temperature the bots get very creative and funky, sometimes too much… Repetition penalty is used to penalise the bot for repeating itself, reduce this parameter and the bot repeats itself a bit more, increase it and it does it a bit less. The default value is 1, I like to set it to 1.15.\n\nBelow is a first example of what our FineTunedAPI class can do. Notice how it sort of makes sense, but still is a little weird (starts message with a comma, doesn’t finish sentence, …): we are going to fix all these things to make a coherent bot.\n\n```\nPython 3.9.9 (main, Nov 16 2021, 03:05:18)  \nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.  \n\\\u003e\u003e\u003e from gpt\\_api import FineTunedAPI  \n\\\u003e\u003e\u003e api = FineTunedAPI(0.5, 1)  \n\\[Neuro Ai\\] 10:02:16 - \\[INFO\\]: DEPLOYMENT MODE  \n\\[Neuro Ai\\] 10:02:16 - \\[INFO\\]: Token successfully authenticated  \n\\[Neuro Ai\\] 10:02:16 - \\[INFO\\]: Using project: Default\\\u003e\u003e\u003e api.request(\"Hello there\")', I’m so happy I found your blog, I really found you by accident, while I was browsing on Bing for something else, Regardless I am'\n```\n\nOne useful perspective to understand what is going on above: the model has been trained on The Pile, a big dataset of text scraped from the web. So when the model responds “, I’m so happy I found your blog, \\[…\\]”, what’s really happening is that it thinks this is a coherent way to continue the sentence that begins by “Hello there”. Which it is! Now we just need to make it act more like it’s in a conversation.\n\nGiving the bot a personality: the ChatAI class\n==============================================\n\nThis is where things get interesting. When we send a request to the GPT-J model, we don’t have to _only_ send it the message we want the response to, we can also provide it with context. For example we can give it a description of the personality we want it to have (a “prompt”) and we can give it examples of conversations it could have (a “chat\\_history”).\n\nIn the code snippet below we define the ChatAI class where we define all the logic to make this happen. For all intents and purposes feel free to ignore all the code except the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ function which is where all the interesting stuff happens. Explanations below.\n\nWhen we make a request to GPT-J we want to send it something that looks a bit like this:\n\n```\nSome description of the bot and perhaps of the user.  \nbot\\_name: a first message  \nUser: a response  \nbot\\_name:\n```\n\nSo that the model knows a bit about who it is impersonating (it has a prompt, in our example this is the first line) and knows it has to complete after “bot\\_name:”. Then as the conversation with the user goes on we send the model all the conversation, so after the bot responds in the above example, if the user sends another message we’d send a request like this one:\n\n```\nSome description of the bot and perhaps of the user.  \nbot\\_name: a first message  \nUser: a response  \nbot\\_name: whatever the bot responded  \nUser: whatever the user responded  \nbot\\_name:\n```\n\nSo when the model is generating a response, it can infer the best response from the rest of the conversation (this is how it can remember the User’s name for example).\n\nTo give the bot the personality you want to give it, edit the **chat\\_history** and **prompt** variables in the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ function! The more information you give, the more information the model can infer from. However you don’t want to make chat\\_history too specific (because it gets interpreted as the start of the conversation: for example if you give the user a name in your initial chat\\_history, the model might think the user is actually called that). If you want to give multiple “example conversations” in the chat\\_history you can just separate them by the string “###” which the model interprets as “end of conversation”. For example:\n\n```\nchat\\_history = \\[  \n\"{bot\\_name}: Hello my name is Chris!\",  \n\"User: Hi Chris\",  \n\"###\",  \n\"{bot\\_name}: Hi there, how are you doing today?\",  \n\"User: I'm feeling a bit down\",  \n\"{bot\\_name}: Is it something I can help with?\"  \n\\]\n```\n\nBringing it all together\n========================\n\nOk, so we have the FineTunedAPI (i.e. a way to ping GetNeuro’s GPT-J API without going through the hassle of doing this ourselves), we also have the ChatAI class which endows the bot with a personality. Now let’s package all this up into one small easy to understand class!\n\nNotice that I put our ChatAI and FineTunedAPI classes into a file called gpt.py, and that I installed the [chaipy package](https://pypi.org/project/chaipy/) (this makes things nice and short + means we can now deploy our bot on the [Chai](http://chai.ml) app for users to speak to it).\n\nAll this class does is make the Bot send the first message (because who wants to message first?) and make sure that the Bot response doesn’t end mid sentence (with the truncate function). Try it out for yourself! It’s very exciting to build a bot that speaks like a human.\n\nAll the code on GitHub for you to use\n=====================================\n\nI put all the code in a [GitHub project](https://github.com/tr416/example_chai_bot/tree/main) for anyone to use. If you want to build a bot and need access to the GetNeuro API, send me a message at dev@chai.ml and I’ll give you the API token and help you get started deploying bots!\n\nBot developers on Chai can see how popular their bots are and how users interact with them: how long are users speaking to the bots, what are they talking about etc. Email dev@chai.ml to get started now!\n\nUploading the bot to Chai for users to speak to it\n==================================================\n\nNow the exciting part, sharing the bot with users and seeing if they like it! Head over to the [Chai developer page](http://chai.ml/dev) to get a developer UID (this takes 30s), then run the uploader.py script (provided in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/tr416/example_chai_bot)). All you have to do is write a short description of your bot and the name, paste your developer UID and run the script! Your bot will then appear in the “Latest” category on Chai. If it’s popular it will also show up in “Trending 🔥”.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*twFx1or5wBDy512fRJvMJg.jpeg)\n\nThe Chai app front page where users discover your bots.\n\nExample conversation\n====================\n\nYou can speak to your bot by running the test.py script. It’s very important to speak to your bot loads to understand how it fails. Once you deploy it on the Chai app you can also see how users speak with it and try to make it better.\n\n```\npython3.9 test.py2022-01-04 12:21:27 | INFO     | Replica | Setting up...  \n\\[Neuro Ai\\] 12:21:27 - \\[INFO\\]: DEPLOYMENT MODE  \n\\[Neuro Ai\\] 12:21:27 - \\[INFO\\]: Token successfully authenticated  \n\\[Neuro Ai\\] 12:21:27 - \\[INFO\\]: Using project: DefaultHi there!

Up until now, we have more than **100 thousand** daily active users on our mobile app with more than **1 million** messages sent per day. You could be part of our journey by helping us build state of the art language models and improve our chatbots.\n\nThe goal of this competition is to make improvements to the state of the art language model and improving the quality of the conversations people have with the chatbots.\n\n## Prize\n\n**$1,000** every time you beat the best score on the MCL leaderboard by at least 0.5. **$500** every time you beat the best score on the Reward model leaderboard.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nSubmissions are first evaluated on the median conversation length (MCL) that actual users will have with your model. When you submit a new model, we will run an A/B test on our app and have users speak it. Your score is the median length of conversations that users have with it.\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\\textbf{score}\u0026space;=\u0026space;MCL_{\\text{your\u0026space;submission}}\u0026space;\u0026space;-\u0026space;MCL_{\\text{top\u0026space;of\u0026space;leaderboard}}\" /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\nSubmissions are also evaluated based on a \u003ca href=\"https://huggingface.co/ChaiML/reward_48m_gpt2_target_2\"\u003eReward Model\u003c/a\u003e score. This reward model scores your model responses, if the score is 0.9, then we estimate a 10% probability that the conversation will end. Higher reward model scores should lead to higher MCL but don't always do. You can run the reward model locally to better understand how to improve your models.\n\n## Leaderboard\n\n#### Median conversation length (MCL)\n\n| Submission  | Participant | Score | Latency (s) |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----- | ----------- |\n| 🥇[hakurei/litv2-6B-rev2](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/litv2-6B-rev2) | Reimu Hakurei | +1.95 | 1.74 |\n| 🥈[hakurei/litv2-6B-rev1](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/litv2-6B-rev1) | Reimu Hakurei | +1.24 | 1.65 |\n| 🥉[hakurei/lit-6B](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/lit-6B) | Reimu Hakurei | +1.12 | 2.17 |\n| [KoboldAI/GPT-J-6B-Shinen](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/GPT-J-6B-Shinen) | Julius ter Pelkwijk | +0.65 | 3.34 |\n| [EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) | EleutherAI | 0 | 2.48 |\n| [KoboldAI/OPT-6B-nerys-v2](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/OPT-6B-nerys-v2) | Julius ter Pelkwijk | -6.31 | 12.80 |\n\n#### Reward model\n\n| Submission  | Participant | Reward |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ------ | \n| 🥇[KoboldAI/GPT-J-6B-Shinen](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/GPT-J-6B-Shinen) | Julius ter Pelkwijk | 0.8803 |\n| 🥈[EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) | EleutherAI | 0.8797 |\n| 🥉[hakurei/litv2-6B-rev2](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/litv2-6B-rev2) | Reimu Hakurei | 0.8796 |\n| [KoboldAI/OPT-6B-nerys-v2](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/OPT-6B-nerys-v2) | Julius ter Pelkwijk | 0.8781 |\n\n\n## Example\n\nThe models we use are hosted on HuggingFace and you can run the example script from our Google Colab [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lsL-XGsZuSmUS_bszbpMuNdyrO_GnWFm?usp=sharing).\n\n## Submission\n\nUpload your model to [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) and send the link to us here. The deadline for submission is January 1, 2023.\n\n\u003ca class=\"button button-primary\" href=\"https://chat.whatsapp.com/LPJ93cH2Kd70iMICwEQeB3\"\u003eSubmit\u003c/a\u003e\n\n## FAQ\n\n1. **How can I submit a model?**  Once you have a model you want to submit, upload it to HuggingFace and share it in the submissions channel for the team to review! We will be in touch with you immediately.\n\n2. **Do you provide computing resources?** At this stage we don't, we expect people will use Colab or their own setup. If this is a massive problem we can look into this with you.\n\n3. **Is latency important?** The latency for our currently deployed models is ~1.5s for an inference. We estimate that for every 1s improvement in latency your score will go up by 0.4MCL. We cannot deploy submissions if they take longer than ~4s per inference.\n\n4. **Can I get some help?** Yes! We are happy to help you with any questions or clarifications. Reach out to us on [WhatsApp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LPJ93cH2Kd70iMICwEQeB3) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/sKQs6PFv).\n\n5. **What is the deadline for submissions?** The competition will run until Jan. 1st 2023.\n\n6. **What happens once I submit?** We will deploy your model asap and be in touch with you. If your solution tops the leaderboard we'll have a call with you to see your code: we want to share winning solutions with other participants so that the community can build on one another's work.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Guide to fine-tuning Text Generation models: GPT-2, GPT-Neo and T5](https://towardsdatascience.com/guide-to-fine-tuning-text-generation-models-gpt-2-gpt-neo-and-t5-dc5de6b3bc5e)\n- Example user conversation dataset on HuggingFace: [ChaiML/user_model_inputs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChaiML/user_model_inputs)"

The primary function of this content is to show you what this package can do. There is a more detailed explanation in the \u003cstrong\u003eGetting Started\u003c/strong\u003e section.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\nYou can view the Python Chai package on [GitHub](https://github.com/chai-nexus/chai_py).\n\n## Authenticating\n\nYou must authenticate using your developer id and key before various operations are possible.\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py.auth import set_auth\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e set_auth('my_developer_uid', 'my_developer_key')\n```\n\nYou can create a key through the [developer portal](https://chai.ml/dev)\n\n## Defining a bot\n\nA bot must inherit from Chai base bot and define an `on_message` method\nwhich responds to a user update with a string response.\n\nFor example a chatbot which just just copies what the users says looks like\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py import ChaiBot, Update\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e class EchoBot(ChaiBot):\n       \"\"\" A simple example bot. \"\"\"\n\n       def setup(self):\n           self.name = 'Echo'\n\n       async def on_message(self, update: Update):\n           return f\"{self.name}: {update.latest_message.text}\"\n```\n\nYou should use a setup method to run code on bot initialisation, you\ncannot override the `__init__` method of a bot.\n\n## Bot state\n\nA bot instance and its state exists for the lifetime of a single conversation\nwith a single user.\n\nLets say you incremented a counter `self.num_messages` every time a user\nmessaged the bot. If one user sent a message to the bot then the counter is\nincremented for that conversation but not for any other users or for another\nconversation the same user was having with the same bot.\n\nState persists even if the app is closed, as long as the user continues with\nthe same conversation later.\n\n## Sending an initial bot message\n\nA bot is automatically sent the string `self.FIRST_MESSAGE_STRING` when a new\nconversation begins.  This will allow you to customise the initial greeting\nmessage.\n\n```python\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e class DummyBot(ChaiBot):\n\n    async def on_message(self, update):\n        if update.latest_message.text == self.FIRST_MESSAGE_STRING:\n            response = 'Welcome to the conversation!'\n        else:\n            response = 'hello again'\n        return response\n```\n\n## Including an image in the bot response\n\nThe bot response accepts markdown and so you can include an image like\n`![image_name](http://image-url/file.jpg)`\n\n## Packaging your bot\n\nA bot class once defined must be packaged before it can be uploaded\n\n```\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py import package, Metadata\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e package(\n        Metadata(\n            name=\"Echo Bot\",\n            image_url='http://image-url/file.png',\n            description=\"Just a simple example.\",\n            developer_uid='test123',\n            input_class=EchoBot,\n            memory=256\n        ),\n        requirements=[\"transformers[torch]\"],\n    )\n```\n\nThe bot metadata lets you configure the bot and accepts the arguments\n\n| param | meaning |\n| -- | -- |\n| name | the name of chatbot as it appears on the app |\n| image | link to image of the chatbot which will be shown on the app |\n| description | the description text which appears under the bot name on the app |\n| input_class | the bot definition class which inherits from `chai_py.ChaiBot` |\n| developer_uid | the user developer uid |\n| memory | how much memory the chatbot should operate with in MB |\n\nPackage also accepts a requirements argument where you can configure python\ndependencies of the bot.\n\nThe result of calling package is to create a file `_package.zip` in the current\ndirectory which can then be uploaded.\n\n## Uploading a bot\n\nIn order to upload a bot you pass a path to the package and a unique bot ID\nwhich must begin with `_bot`\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from from chai_py import upload_and_deploy\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e bot_uid = upload_and_deploy('_package.zip', bot_uid=None)\n```\n\nIf you do not provide a bot ID then one will be automatically generated and\nwritten to a file `_deployment` which you will be prompted to reuse the next\ntime you upload.\n\nAfter uploading a bot you can poll for it to finish uploading.\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py import wait_for_deployment\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e wait_for_deployment(bot_uid)\n```\n\n## Viewing or sharing your bot\n\nIn order to interact with or share your deployed plot you can produce a QR code from the\nbot ID and scan this with your phone\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py.deployment import advertise_deployed_bot\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e advertise_deployed_bot(bot_uid)\n```\n\nYou will be promopted to either view your QR code directly or save it to a file.\n\n## Querying for your deployed bots\n\nYou can retrieve a list of the bots you have deployed by calling\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py import deployed\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e my_bots = deployed.get_bots()\n```\n\nThis is useful to find you deployed bot IDs and whether they are visible to users of the app.\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e print(my_bots[0])\n\nDeployedBot(bot_uid='_bot_example', name='Echo Bot', developer_uid='abc123', status='inactive')\n```\n\n## Making a deployed bot visible to other users\n\nBy default an uploaded bot is only visible using a QR code. If you want it to\nbe discoverable on the app you must activate it first using the bot ID.\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py import deployed\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e deployed.activate_bot(bot_uid)\n```\n\nIn order to prevent your bot from being dicovered by users you can call\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e deployed.deactivate_bot(bot_uid)\n```\n\nCurrently users must be whitelisted to be able to activate their bot, speak to\nus over WhatsApp or Discord and we can give you permission.\n\n## Debugging a bot with errors\n\nIf your bot is failing to respond it may be that it has an error. You can retrieve the logs in order to investigate further\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py import cloud_logs\n\u003e\u003e\u003e logs = cloud_logs.get_logs(bot_uid)\n\u003e\u003e\u003e cloud_logs.display_logs(logs)\n```"

We’ll be using an API to ping the [GPT-J model](https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/07/eleutherai-gpt-j/), the current best performing open-source Transformer model. We’ll encode a personality for this bot. Then we’ll deploy it so that hundreds of users can speak to it on [Chai](http://chai.ml), a chat-bot platform.\n\nAt Chai we have built and deployed many chatbots which currently send almost 200,000 messages / day to users, I will share a lot of the tricks we have discovered to make a good bot. All the code is in python 3.\n\nTable of contents:\n------------------\n\n· [An API for GPT-J](#684c)  \n· [Giving the bot a personality: the ChatAI class](#5ed4)  \n· [Bringing it all together](#e3c1)  \n· [All the code on GitHub for you to use](#4e98)  \n· [Uploading the bot to Chai for users to speak to it](#4c11)  \n· [Example conversation](#6503)\n\nLet’s build up to a full fledged chat-bot: first we’ll get set-up with an API to ping GPT-J, then we’ll build a ChatAI class where we define the personality of the bot, then we’ll package that into a very short python class (less than 20 lines of code!). Finally, we’ll upload the bot to [Chai](http://chai.ml).\n\nAn API for GPT-J\n================\n\nThere’s two ways we could use GPT-J: either we can install it on your machine and run it locally, or we could have it run on a server and access it through an API. Running locally is fine but is a bit trickier and doesn’t scale as well (we want to have hundreds of people speak to the bots!). So we’ll be using the [GetNeuro API](https://www.getneuro.ai/). GetNeuro charges for this but if you want to build a good bot I will give you my access credentials (email me at: dev@chai.ml).\n\nLine 27 is where we query the API provided by GetNeuro. What’s most interesting when building chat-bots is **making them sound like humans**. The first place we can do this is in the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ where we define the **temperature** and **repetition penalty** parameters. Low temperature means the model will be conservative and only return responses it is very confident make sense, high temperature means the model will send responses it is less certain of. When you set too low temperature the chat bots are very consistent but a bit boring, when you set too high temperature the bots get very creative and funky, sometimes too much… Repetition penalty is used to penalise the bot for repeating itself, reduce this parameter and the bot repeats itself a bit more, increase it and it does it a bit less. The default value is 1, I like to set it to 1.15.\n\nBelow is a first example of what our FineTunedAPI class can do. Notice how it sort of makes sense, but still is a little weird (starts message with a comma, doesn’t finish sentence, …): we are going to fix all these things to make a coherent bot.\n\n```\nPython 3.9.9 (main, Nov 16 2021, 03:05:18)  \nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.  \n\\\u003e\u003e\u003e from gpt\\_api import FineTunedAPI  \n\\\u003e\u003e\u003e api = FineTunedAPI(0.5, 1)  \n\\[Neuro Ai\\] 10:02:16 - \\[INFO\\]: DEPLOYMENT MODE  \n\\[Neuro Ai\\] 10:02:16 - \\[INFO\\]: Token successfully authenticated  \n\\[Neuro Ai\\] 10:02:16 - \\[INFO\\]: Using project: Default\\\u003e\u003e\u003e api.request(\"Hello there\")', I’m so happy I found your blog, I really found you by accident, while I was browsing on Bing for something else, Regardless I am'\n```\n\nOne useful perspective to understand what is going on above: the model has been trained on The Pile, a big dataset of text scraped from the web. So when the model responds “, I’m so happy I found your blog, \\[…\\]”, what’s really happening is that it thinks this is a coherent way to continue the sentence that begins by “Hello there”. Which it is! Now we just need to make it act more like it’s in a conversation.\n\nGiving the bot a personality: the ChatAI class\n==============================================\n\nThis is where things get interesting. When we send a request to the GPT-J model, we don’t have to _only_ send it the message we want the response to, we can also provide it with context. For example we can give it a description of the personality we want it to have (a “prompt”) and we can give it examples of conversations it could have (a “chat\\_history”).\n\nIn the code snippet below we define the ChatAI class where we define all the logic to make this happen. For all intents and purposes feel free to ignore all the code except the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ function which is where all the interesting stuff happens. Explanations below.\n\nWhen we make a request to GPT-J we want to send it something that looks a bit like this:\n\n```\nSome description of the bot and perhaps of the user.  \nbot\\_name: a first message  \nUser: a response  \nbot\\_name:\n```\n\nSo that the model knows a bit about who it is impersonating (it has a prompt, in our example this is the first line) and knows it has to complete after “bot\\_name:”. Then as the conversation with the user goes on we send the model all the conversation, so after the bot responds in the above example, if the user sends another message we’d send a request like this one:\n\n```\nSome description of the bot and perhaps of the user.  \nbot\\_name: a first message  \nUser: a response  \nbot\\_name: whatever the bot responded  \nUser: whatever the user responded  \nbot\\_name:\n```\n\nSo when the model is generating a response, it can infer the best response from the rest of the conversation (this is how it can remember the User’s name for example).\n\nTo give the bot the personality you want to give it, edit the **chat\\_history** and **prompt** variables in the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ function! The more information you give, the more information the model can infer from. However you don’t want to make chat\\_history too specific (because it gets interpreted as the start of the conversation: for example if you give the user a name in your initial chat\\_history, the model might think the user is actually called that). If you want to give multiple “example conversations” in the chat\\_history you can just separate them by the string “###” which the model interprets as “end of conversation”. For example:\n\n```\nchat\\_history = \\[  \n\"{bot\\_name}: Hello my name is Chris!\",  \n\"User: Hi Chris\",  \n\"###\",  \n\"{bot\\_name}: Hi there, how are you doing today?\",  \n\"User: I'm feeling a bit down\",  \n\"{bot\\_name}: Is it something I can help with?\"  \n\\]\n```\n\nBringing it all together\n========================\n\nOk, so we have the FineTunedAPI (i.e. a way to ping GetNeuro’s GPT-J API without going through the hassle of doing this ourselves), we also have the ChatAI class which endows the bot with a personality. Now let’s package all this up into one small easy to understand class!\n\nNotice that I put our ChatAI and FineTunedAPI classes into a file called gpt.py, and that I installed the [chaipy package](https://pypi.org/project/chaipy/) (this makes things nice and short + means we can now deploy our bot on the [Chai](http://chai.ml) app for users to speak to it).\n\nAll this class does is make the Bot send the first message (because who wants to message first?) and make sure that the Bot response doesn’t end mid sentence (with the truncate function). Try it out for yourself! It’s very exciting to build a bot that speaks like a human.\n\nAll the code on GitHub for you to use\n=====================================\n\nI put all the code in a [GitHub project](https://github.com/tr416/example_chai_bot/tree/main) for anyone to use. If you want to build a bot and need access to the GetNeuro API, send me a message at dev@chai.ml and I’ll give you the API token and help you get started deploying bots!\n\nBot developers on Chai can see how popular their bots are and how users interact with them: how long are users speaking to the bots, what are they talking about etc. Email dev@chai.ml to get started now!\n\nUploading the bot to Chai for users to speak to it\n==================================================\n\nNow the exciting part, sharing the bot with users and seeing if they like it! Head over to the [Chai developer page](http://chai.ml/dev) to get a developer UID (this takes 30s), then run the uploader.py script (provided in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/tr416/example_chai_bot)). All you have to do is write a short description of your bot and the name, paste your developer UID and run the script! Your bot will then appear in the “Latest” category on Chai. If it’s popular it will also show up in “Trending 🔥”.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*twFx1or5wBDy512fRJvMJg.jpeg)\n\nThe Chai app front page where users discover your bots.\n\nExample conversation\n====================\n\nYou can speak to your bot by running the test.py script. It’s very important to speak to your bot loads to understand how it fails. Once you deploy it on the Chai app you can also see how users speak with it and try to make it better.\n\n```\npython3.9 test.py2022-01-04 12:21:27 | INFO     | Replica | Setting up...  \n\\[Neuro Ai\\] 12:21:27 - \\[INFO\\]: DEPLOYMENT MODE  \n\\[Neuro Ai\\] 12:21:27 - \\[INFO\\]: Token successfully authenticated  \n\\[Neuro Ai\\] 12:21:27 - \\[INFO\\]: Using project: DefaultHi there!

The deadline for submission is January 1, 2023.\n\n\u003ca class=\"button button-primary\" href=\"https://chat.whatsapp.com/LPJ93cH2Kd70iMICwEQeB3\"\u003eSubmit\u003c/a\u003e\n\n## FAQ\n\n1. **How can I submit a model?**  Once you have a model you want to submit, upload it to HuggingFace and share it in the submissions channel for the team to review! We will be in touch with you immediately.\n\n2. **Do you provide computing resources?** At this stage we don't, we expect people will use Colab or their own setup. If this is a massive problem we can look into this with you.\n\n3. **Is latency important?** The latency for our currently deployed models is ~1.5s for an inference. We estimate that for every 1s improvement in latency your score will go up by 0.4MCL. We cannot deploy submissions if they take longer than ~4s per inference.\n\n4. **Can I get some help?** Yes! We are happy to help you with any questions or clarifications. Reach out to us on [WhatsApp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LPJ93cH2Kd70iMICwEQeB3) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/sKQs6PFv).\n\n5. **What is the deadline for submissions?** The competition will run until Jan. 1st 2023.\n\n6. **What happens once I submit?** We will deploy your model asap and be in touch with you. If your solution tops the leaderboard we'll have a call with you to see your code: we want to share winning solutions with other participants so that the community can build on one another's work.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Guide to fine-tuning Text Generation models: GPT-2, GPT-Neo and T5](https://towardsdatascience.com/guide-to-fine-tuning-text-generation-models-gpt-2-gpt-neo-and-t5-dc5de6b3bc5e)\n- Example user conversation dataset on HuggingFace: [ChaiML/user_model_inputs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChaiML/user_model_inputs)"

There is a more detailed explanation in the \u003cstrong\u003eGetting Started\u003c/strong\u003e section.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\nYou can view the Python Chai package on [GitHub](https://github.com/chai-nexus/chai_py).\n\n## Authenticating\n\nYou must authenticate using your developer id and key before various operations are possible.\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py.auth import set_auth\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e set_auth('my_developer_uid', 'my_developer_key')\n```\n\nYou can create a key through the [developer portal](https://chai.ml/dev)\n\n## Defining a bot\n\nA bot must inherit from Chai base bot and define an `on_message` method\nwhich responds to a user update with a string response.\n\nFor example a chatbot which just just copies what the users says looks like\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py import ChaiBot, Update\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e class EchoBot(ChaiBot):\n       \"\"\" A simple example bot. \"\"\"\n\n       def setup(self):\n           self.name = 'Echo'\n\n       async def on_message(self, update: Update):\n           return f\"{self.name}: {update.latest_message.text}\"\n```\n\nYou should use a setup method to run code on bot initialisation, you\ncannot override the `__init__` method of a bot.\n\n## Bot state\n\nA bot instance and its state exists for the lifetime of a single conversation\nwith a single user.\n\nLets say you incremented a counter `self.num_messages` every time a user\nmessaged the bot. If one user sent a message to the bot then the counter is\nincremented for that conversation but not for any other users or for another\nconversation the same user was having with the same bot.\n\nState persists even if the app is closed, as long as the user continues with\nthe same conversation later.\n\n## Sending an initial bot message\n\nA bot is automatically sent the string `self.FIRST_MESSAGE_STRING` when a new\nconversation begins.  This will allow you to customise the initial greeting\nmessage.\n\n```python\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e class DummyBot(ChaiBot):\n\n    async def on_message(self, update):\n        if update.latest_message.text == self.FIRST_MESSAGE_STRING:\n            response = 'Welcome to the conversation!'\n        else:\n            response = 'hello again'\n        return response\n```\n\n## Including an image in the bot response\n\nThe bot response accepts markdown and so you can include an image like\n`![image_name](http://image-url/file.jpg)`\n\n## Packaging your bot\n\nA bot class once defined must be packaged before it can be uploaded\n\n```\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py import package, Metadata\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e package(\n        Metadata(\n            name=\"Echo Bot\",\n            image_url='http://image-url/file.png',\n            description=\"Just a simple example.\",\n            developer_uid='test123',\n            input_class=EchoBot,\n            memory=256\n        ),\n        requirements=[\"transformers[torch]\"],\n    )\n```\n\nThe bot metadata lets you configure the bot and accepts the arguments\n\n| param | meaning |\n| -- | -- |\n| name | the name of chatbot as it appears on the app |\n| image | link to image of the chatbot which will be shown on the app |\n| description | the description text which appears under the bot name on the app |\n| input_class | the bot definition class which inherits from `chai_py.ChaiBot` |\n| developer_uid | the user developer uid |\n| memory | how much memory the chatbot should operate with in MB |\n\nPackage also accepts a requirements argument where you can configure python\ndependencies of the bot.\n\nThe result of calling package is to create a file `_package.zip` in the current\ndirectory which can then be uploaded.\n\n## Uploading a bot\n\nIn order to upload a bot you pass a path to the package and a unique bot ID\nwhich must begin with `_bot`\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from from chai_py import upload_and_deploy\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e bot_uid = upload_and_deploy('_package.zip', bot_uid=None)\n```\n\nIf you do not provide a bot ID then one will be automatically generated and\nwritten to a file `_deployment` which you will be prompted to reuse the next\ntime you upload.\n\nAfter uploading a bot you can poll for it to finish uploading.\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py import wait_for_deployment\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e wait_for_deployment(bot_uid)\n```\n\n## Viewing or sharing your bot\n\nIn order to interact with or share your deployed plot you can produce a QR code from the\nbot ID and scan this with your phone\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py.deployment import advertise_deployed_bot\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e advertise_deployed_bot(bot_uid)\n```\n\nYou will be promopted to either view your QR code directly or save it to a file.\n\n## Querying for your deployed bots\n\nYou can retrieve a list of the bots you have deployed by calling\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py import deployed\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e my_bots = deployed.get_bots()\n```\n\nThis is useful to find you deployed bot IDs and whether they are visible to users of the app.\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e print(my_bots[0])\n\nDeployedBot(bot_uid='_bot_example', name='Echo Bot', developer_uid='abc123', status='inactive')\n```\n\n## Making a deployed bot visible to other users\n\nBy default an uploaded bot is only visible using a QR code. If you want it to\nbe discoverable on the app you must activate it first using the bot ID.\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py import deployed\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e deployed.activate_bot(bot_uid)\n```\n\nIn order to prevent your bot from being dicovered by users you can call\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e deployed.deactivate_bot(bot_uid)\n```\n\nCurrently users must be whitelisted to be able to activate their bot, speak to\nus over WhatsApp or Discord and we can give you permission.\n\n## Debugging a bot with errors\n\nIf your bot is failing to respond it may be that it has an error. You can retrieve the logs in order to investigate further\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from chai_py import cloud_logs\n\u003e\u003e\u003e logs = cloud_logs.get_logs(bot_uid)\n\u003e\u003e\u003e cloud_logs.display_logs(logs)\n```"
